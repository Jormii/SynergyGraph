# SynergyGraph

This was an attempt at creating a program that would calculate synergies between game characters and their mechanics in order to find optimal and fun (but theorically working) team compositions.

I'm dropping it because I've realized I would either need to simplify the representation of mechanics a lot in order to make it feasible and easy to work with or, worst even, building the program would be identical to creating a simulator, at which point I rather experiment in the game itself.
